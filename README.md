# fasthpluspaper

This is the repository containing the code to reproduce the analyses and figures in Dyjack et al. (2022) introducing the metric H+ and the `fasthplus` R package (https://github.com/ntdyjack/fasthplus), which has been submitted to CRAN. 

### Introduction

The `fasthplus` R package provides fast approximations for metrics of
discordance or dissimilarity.

The metric G+ was
[introduced by W. T. Williams in 1971](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1218253)
as a way to measure the discordance or dissimilarity between two different classifications (where the classification consists of distance matrix and a set of predicted labels for each observation).

Here, we introduce the H+, a discordance metric modified from G+.
This metric can be used (1) to evaluate the discordance between two arbitrary sets or (2) to evaluate label fitness (clustering) for a generalized dissimilarity matrix.
